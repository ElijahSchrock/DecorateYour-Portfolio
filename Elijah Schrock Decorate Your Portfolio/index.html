    <h3>
      About Me
    </h3>
  <div class="about-me">
      <p>"I love thinkning outside the box and thinking about how things work and why they work the way they do. I am extremely passsionate about learning. I am always thinking about how things work or why it works the way it does. Not only do I love software engineering, I have a passion for making things and tinkering. Using my 3D printer to print parts that I can include in a project that is ran off a microcontroller that I soldered and programmed together is a beautiful pairing of hardware and software. One of my favorite hobbies is doing stand-up comedy open-mic's. I beleive it allows me to creatively express the over analytical thoughts I have on just about everything. I try to keep an open mind about every topic I face because I belive that not allowing myself to never be open to an idea that counters mine, I hinder my chances of learning greatly. I hold myself to very high standards and set goals for myself that may seem far fethced to most but to me, it is even more motivation to accomplish these dreams that many give up on."</p>
