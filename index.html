  <div class="about-me">
      <p>"I love thinking outside the box and thinking about how things work and why they work the way they do. I am extremely passsionate about learning. I am always thinking about how things work or why it works the way it does. Not only do I love software engineering, I have a passion for making things and tinkering. Using my 3D printer to print parts that I can include in a project that is ran off a microcontroller that I soldered and programmed together is a beautiful pairing of hardware and software. One of my favorite hobbies is doing stand-up comedy open-mic's. I believe it allows me to creatively express the over analytical thoughts I have on just about everything. I try to keep an open mind about every topic I face because I believe that not allowing myself to never be open to an idea that counters mine, I hinder my chances of learning greatly. I hold myself to very high standards and set goals for myself that may seem far fethced to most but to me, it is even more motivation to accomplish these dreams that many give up on."</p>

            </a>
            <p>This is a wooden box that I made for my wife as her wedding gift. With Walnut wood as the base and Cherry wood as the lid, I programmed an Arduino Nano to use RFID and upon scanning, the box lid will lift open via sg90 servo and 3D printed arms that I have created. I soldered all the hardware together and included a 9v battery connector so the system can be turned off and on by disconecting the battery.</p>

              <p>This is a website I coded from scratch utlizing HTML and CSS. All links are clickable and the contact information will redirect and start an email, phone call, or even pull a google maps location so you can get directions to this mock restaurant. Clicking the logo on the top of the page will take you back to the home page.</p>

              </a>
                <p>This is a game I built called 'Neo Runner'. It is an endless runner style game with obstacles to dodge, points to be collected, and a leaderboard to top! Using Node.js, Express, and SQLite I built a server and database to collect the scores of each player and then display the top 10 high scores on the game-over page. This was a very fun project utilizing Three.js, DOM Manipulation, HTML, CSS and many more techniques. If you'd like to view my code on github <a href="https://github.com/ElijahSchrock/Neo-Runner" target="_blank"><b>Click Here</b></a> and if you would like to play the game, click the Neo Runner title above!</p>
